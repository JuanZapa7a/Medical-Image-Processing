        "Mask R-CNN extends [Faster R-CNN](http://paperswithcode.com/method/faster-r-cnn) to solve instance segmentation tasks. It achieves this by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. In principle, Mask R-CNN is an intuitive extension of Faster R-CNN, but constructing the mask branch properly is critical for good results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most importantly, Faster R-CNN was not designed for pixel-to-pixel alignment between network inputs and outputs. This is evident in how [RoIPool](http://paperswithcode.com/method/roi-pooling), the de facto core operation for attending to instances, performs coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction. To fix the misalignment, Mask R-CNN utilises a simple, quantization-free layer, called [RoIAlign](http://paperswithcode.com/method/roi-align), that faithfully preserves exact spatial locations.\n",

We also provide ambiguous area masks for the entire dataset to show in which areas manual semantic/instance segmentation were impossible.\n"
